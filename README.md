mvGestureExtension
==================

A simple, and poorly made, extension that does two things:

Executes certain commands whe you hit the buttons (scrolling up/down, refresh the page, etc.)

Connects to an external server, and waits for instructions to execute these commands

This project is meant to be run along side mvGestureServer
